# PHOENIX
## Amazing exercises to get in shape

In this project we decided to focus on the fitness world with an app that takes a .json file full of exercises (873 in total) and allows the user to customize their own fitness plan for the week.

# Challenges

Connecting the exercises list page with the weekly plan page was one key blocker in our project, but Julia managed to solve it.

# How to run this app 

You can clone this repo into your own device and install some dependencies such as 'npm install'.
You will also need to create an environment file (.env) and fill it in with a PORT=# and a SESSION_SECRET=''.
Finally, you can run it with 'npm run dev' and it should run in the local host in the port that you specified earlier.
